<h2>Building a PoS tagged corpus for Sorani Kurdish</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">The process of classifying words into their parts of speech and labelling them accordingly is known as part-of-speech (PoS) tagging, or grammatical tagging. In the current project, we build, to the best of our knowledge, the first accurate automatic tagger for a less-resourced language, Sorani Kurdish.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">We can consider the task of tagging in two levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>morphological tagging which is about the tags of the morphological parts of a word. For example, "hełhatim" = "heł" → verbal suffix, "hat" → verb stem, "im" → 1st person verb ending.</li>
<li>syntactic tagging which concerns each word of a phrase. For instance, "barandebarê" = "baran" → noun, "debarê" → verb.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify">We have already collected the morphological rules of Sorani Kurdish and the grammatical tags. This will partially solve the problem of morphological tagging. However, in order to create accurate taggers, manually tagged corpus are essential. In this stage of the project, we are aiming at creating a manually tagged corpus that will enable us to tackle more challenges in Kurdish language processing.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">This report is only addressed to the annotators.</p>

<h3>Task definition</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">The task of the annotator, in its simplest definition, is to relate each word to its tag set. Given a list of words (in excel format), we want to decide which word belongs to which syntactic set (such as noun, adjective, verb etc.). This set is based on the <a href="http://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/" target="_blank">Universal POS tags</a> . A detailed description of each tag is presented in the table below.</p>

</figure> 
</div>

<p style="text-align:justify">In this phase of the project, we would like to create a seed lexicon. A seed lexicon contains only lemmas. So, if a word is declined, its lemma should be added and the declined form should be removed. For instance, for "bîndrawe", "bînîn" as the lemma is to kept while the original form should be omitted.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Since the Arabic orthography of Kurdish is ambiguous in terms of properly representing Bizroke, i.e. "i" phoneme, the corpus is transliterated into Latin orthography using Wergor. The transliterated words in most of the cases need manual correction as well. <b>This is also to be done by the annotators</b>. The following figure illustrates the equivalent characters in Latin and Arabic- based orthographies of Sorani Kurdish.</p>

  <figcaption>Equivalent characters in Latin and Arabic-based orthographies of Sorani Kurdish</figcaption>
</figure> 
</div>


<h3>Corpus</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">The corpus to be tagged is based on the Pewan corpus. As the first text corpus of Kurdish, Pewan contains over 115,000 Sorani and 25,000 Kurmanji news articles. The normalized and tokenized data set extracted from Pewan will be annotated in Excel format by the annotators.</p>


<h3> Technical points</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">In order to manage time in the best possible way, we ask annotators to use numbers instead of the name of the tags. This will prevent excessive copying and pasting. If a word belongs to more than one set, numbers are to be separated by a comma.</p>

<div id="wrapper" style="width:100%; text-align:center">
  <figure>
  <img src="imgs/annotation_example.png" alt="annotation example" width="100%" height="100%" >
  <figcaption>An annotation example. Instead of the name of the tags, relating numbers are used.</figcaption>
</figure> 
</div>



<p style="text-align:justify">The figure above shows an annotating example. In this example, "abřwçun" needs to be correctly rewritten as "abřû çûn". Spaces are allowed in compound verbs. Then, "abřû" and "çûn" must be added also as two separate entries. And finally, each one must be related to its corresponding tag number ("abřû çûn"=3, "abřû"=1 and "çûn"=3).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The relating number for each tag is described as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>invalid = X (for the case the word is not correct at all. It saves more time than deleting it)
<li>Adjective = 0
<li>Noun = 1
<li>Adverb = 2
<li>Infinitive verb = 3
<li>Proper noun = 4
<li>Adposition = 5 
<li>Cord. Conj. = 6
<li>Numeral = 7
<li>Pronoun = 8
<li>interjection = 9
<li>other = 10 (if you find something out of those sets just type 10)
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify">These numbers are also provided in the header of each excel file. Annotators must also keep in mind that the final data set will be processed entirely. Therefore, no concern about removing redundancy or normalizing layout.</p>
