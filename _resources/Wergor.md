## About

[Wergor](https://github.com/sinaahmadi/wergor){:target="_blank"} is a transliteration system for Sorani Kurdish Latin-based and Arabic-based orthographies. In this first version, we have used a rule-based method. It is the result of a research project published in the ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing (TALLIP) and can be downloaded here: [https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3278623](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3278623){:target="_blank"}.

Wergor comes with a transliteration corpus which includes 20k manually transliterated Sorani Kurdish words in the Arabic-based and the Latin-based orthographies.
