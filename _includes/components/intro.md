This is my personal website where I share the latest news about myself and my professional life. I also discuss my ideas and whatever I think is worth to write about here in my blog.

As of February 2019, I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) at the [National University of Ireland, Galway](http://www.nuigalway.ie/) where I am advised by [Dr. John McCrae](https://john.mccr.ae/index) and [Dr. Mihael Arcan](https://nuig.insight-centre.org/unlp/people/members/mihael-arcan/) in the [Unit for Natural Language Processing](https://nuig.insight-centre.org/unlp/). My research is broadly on cross-lingual data linking and natural language processing (NLP). My Ph.D. project is supported by the Insight Centre and [ELEXIS](https://elex.is/) - a European Lexicographic Infrastructure.
