This is my personal website where I share the latest news about myself and my professional life. I also discuss my ideas and whatever I think is worth to write about here in my blog.

<hr />

From July 2021, I am a visiting researcher at [ATILF](https://www.atilf.fr/){:target="_blank"} and [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr/fr/){:target="_blank"}.

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/){:target="_blank"} at the [National University of Ireland, Galway](http://www.nuigalway.ie/){:target="_blank"} where I am advised by [Dr. John McCrae](https://john.mccr.ae/index){:target="_blank"} in the [Unit for Linguistic Data](https://nuig.insight-centre.org/uld){:target="_blank"}. My research is broadly on lexicographic data linking and natural language processing (NLP). My Ph.D. project is supported by the Insight Centre and [ELEXIS](https://elex.is/){:target="_blank"} - a European Lexicographic Infrastructure.
