	<p><b>Halli und Hallo and welcome to Christian Schuler's home on the web!</b></p>
</div>

I am about to finish my masters degree in computer science and aim to do a PhD following that :D

This site is obviously very much still work-in-progress, but you can already read a bit in the sections about my [publications](/publications/), [teaching](/teaching/) I have done until now, some of my [projects](/projects/), [events](/events/) I have attended, and finally my [CV](/cv/).

Any questions? Or maybe just want to chat about some cool ideas?

Please feel free to contact me any time: christianschuler8989(Ç¼)gmail.com
