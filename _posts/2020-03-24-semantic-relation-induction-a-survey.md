## Introduction 

There exists a vast amount of lexicographical data, including dictionaries, thesauri, Wordnet and so on, that are distinctly providing various information about words. The automatic alignment of such resources is currently a challenging task.

In a recent attempt to address the task of monolingual word sense alignment (MWSA), we created a set of monolingual datasets containing manual annotations of semantic relationships between senses across resources. However, the sheer volume and heterogeneity of data make human annotation limited. Instead, we would like to have a computer annotate all data with the structure of our interest. Normally, we are interested in relations between word definitions, a.k.a. senses. 

$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$

$$k_{n+1} = n^2 + k_n^2 - k_{n-1}$$
