Text preprocessing is one of the tasks that most of those working with text files in natural language processing (NLP) or data analytics go through frequently. Text pre-processing is a normalisation step which is an inseparable component of text processing tasks such as

 text by removing special tokens, adding


 {% highlight bash %}
 	(France, capital, Paris)
 	(Paris, population, 2141000)
 {% endhighlight %}




### Basic text statistics

wc [-clmw] [file ...]

A word count command could not have a more explicit name than `wc`. `wc` is a very practical command which counts line, word and character. In addition, there are a bunch of other options which may be used with. The following command summarises `wc` and the functions of its options:

<table align="center" class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
<tr>
<th title="Field #1">Option</th>
<th title="Field #2">Function</th>
</tr>
<tr >
<td><b>-c</b></td>
<td>print the number of bytes. This will cancel out any prior usage of the -m option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>-m</b></td>
<td>print the character counts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>-l</b></td>
<td>print the newline counts.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Converting from character cases

tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < input

## Find the n most frequent words

tr -c '[:alnum:]' '[\n*]' < test.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head  -10

If you don't put in a sort before the uniq -c you'll probably get a lot of false singleton words. uniq only does unique runs of lines, not overall uniquness.

## Replace punctuation marks 

cat head.txt | sed 's/[[:punct:]]/ /g'

## Strip multiple spaces to one using sed

 sed 's/  */ /g'

## Split sentences by line in a text

sed -e :1 -e 's/\([.?!]\)[[:blank:]]\{1,\}\([^[:blank:]]\)/\1\\2/;t1'

### Remove metadata of PDF

Although anonymization of files is not that much related to the command-line, we also discuss as it is a part of pre-processing.

This blog post describes the conversion tool that I created to convert tabular data into Ontolex-Lemon in RDF. Find the repository at [https://github.com/sinaahmadi/Tabular2Lexicog](https://github.com/sinaahmadi/Tabular2Lexicog){:target="_blank"}.

The [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/){:target="_blank"} as an extension of the [World Wide Web (WWW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web){:target="_blank"} represents an effective means of data representation and enables users and computers to retrieve and share information efficiently. The [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](https://www.w3.org/RDF/){:target="_blank"} is the foundational data model for Semantic Web. Unlike traditional databases, such as [relational ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database){:target="_blank"}, where data has to adhere to a fixed schema, RDF documents are not prescribed by a schema and can be described without additional information making RDF data model self-describing.

More recently, the concept of the Web of Linked Data, which makes RDF data available using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and [Linguistic Linked Open Data](http://linguistic-lod.org/){:target="_blank"} has gained traction along with the Semantic Web, particularly in the [natural language processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing){:target="_blank"} community as a standard for linguistic resource creation. According to the [official definition](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data){:target="_blank"} of W3C:

<div class="ml-3">
<p class="text-muted" >
Linked Data lies at the heart of what Semantic Web is all about: large scale integration of, and reasoning on, data on the Web. Almost all applications listed in, say collection of Semantic Web Case Studies and Use Cases are essentially based on the accessibility of, and integration of Linked Data at various level of complexities. 
</p>
</div>

Moreover, the unique potential which the Semantic Web and Linked Data offer to e-lexicography enables interoperability across lexical resources by leveraging printed or unstructured linguistic data to machine-readable semantic formats.

To know more about RDF, you can read one of my previous blog posts on [data modelling with RDF](https://sinaahmadi.github.io/posts/rdf-data-modelling-a-tutorial.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Ontolex-Lemon and Lexicog

Lexicography is the science of words and their semantic relationships. Wouldn't it be beneficial to take advantage of linked data for lexicography too? Well, this is the motivation behind Ontolex-Lemon. 

[Lemon](https://lemon-model.net/){:target="_blank"} stands for the lexicon model for ontologies (*lemon*) which provides rich linguistic grounding for ontologies. By rich, the creators theoretically aim at all types of information related to words in dictionaries, such as morphological and syntactic properties. The [Ontolex-Lemon](https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/){:target="_blank"} is the result of the [W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/){:target="_blank"}.

One of the useful modules in Ontolex-Lemon is the [Ontolex-Lemon lexicography module (lexicog)](https://jogracia.github.io/ontolex-lexicog/){:target="_blank"}.
