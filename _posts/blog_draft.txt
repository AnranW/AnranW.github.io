Text preprocessing is one of the tasks that most of those working with text files in natural language processing (NLP) or data analytics go through frequently. Text pre-processing is a normalisation step which is an inseparable component of text processing tasks such as

 text by removing special tokens, adding


 {% highlight bash %}
 	(France, capital, Paris)
 	(Paris, population, 2141000)
 {% endhighlight %}




### Basic text statistics

wc [-clmw] [file ...]

A word count command could not have a more explicit name than `wc`. `wc` is a very practical command which counts line, word and character. In addition, there are a bunch of other options which may be used with. The following command summarises `wc` and the functions of its options:

<table align="center" class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
<tr>
<th title="Field #1">Option</th>
<th title="Field #2">Function</th>
</tr>
<tr >
<td><b>-c</b></td>
<td>print the number of bytes. This will cancel out any prior usage of the -m option.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>-m</b></td>
<td>print the character counts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>-l</b></td>
<td>print the newline counts.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Although anonymization of files is not that much related to the command-line, we also discuss as it is a part of pre-processing.
