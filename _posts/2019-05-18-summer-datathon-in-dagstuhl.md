Last week, I participated in the 3rd Summer Datathon on Linguistic Linked Open Data ([SD-LLOD-19])(https://datathon2019.linguistic-lod.org/) which was held in the Schloss Dagstuhl â€“ Leibniz Center for Informatics, Wadern, Germany. As my first datathon where I was a tutor, it was such an amazing experience that I would like to write about here.
