I hold an M.Sc. in Machine Learning from [Paris Descartes University](http://www.mi.parisdescartes.fr/formations/master-informatique/specialite-intelligence-artificielle/) (2016-17) and an M.Sc. in Natural Language Processing from [Sorbonne Nouvelle University](http://www.univ-paris3.fr/) (2014-16). During my masters, I worked in different research groups, namely at [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en), [LIMSI](https://www.limsi.fr/en/), and [LIPN](http://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/), on quite various fields of co-reference resolution, language generation and, neural machine translation (here is one of [my master's theses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00660)). Back in 2013, as a member of the Kurdish Language Processing Project ([KLPP](http://klpp.github.io/)) I developed some of the fundamental language processing tools for Kurdish. I obtained my B.Sc. in Software Engineering in 2014 at [University of Kurdistan](https://en.uok.ac.ir/EN), Faculty of Engineering.

As a multidisciplinary explorer, my research experiences and academic background lie at the junction of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am also interested in applied mathematics, less-resourced languages processing and particularly, Kurdish language processing. I still work on Kurdish-related NLP projects part-time in collaboration with Kurdish-BLARK. 

On my personal side, I have a voracious appetite for knowledge about languages, history and astronomy, among which the latter is my least discovered one. I am very interested in Hellenism, with all its glorious aspects, and more generally, in discovering the reasons of the rise and fall of civilizations. I spend most of my spare time on learning languages, currently Modern Greek and German. Although I like all types of art, my only windows through the artistic world is violin. I have had two public performances so far, [Vivaldi's Concerto in A minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTPiZup0QmM) in my [home town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanandaj), and [Telemann's concerto for 4 violins No. 2 in D major](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZIRE-9EL-E) in Hôpital de la Collégiale.
