## Welcome to Sina Ahmadi's Personal Page

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) at the [National University of Ireland, Galway](http://www.nuigalway.ie/). Working with [Dr. John McCrae](https://john.mccr.ae/index) and [Dr. Mihael Arcan](https://nuig.insight-centre.org/unlp/people/members/mihael-arcan/) in the [Unit for Natural Language Processing](https://nuig.insight-centre.org/unlp/), my research focuses on cross-lingual data linking. My Ph.D. project is supported by the Insight Centre and [ELEXIS](https://elex.is/) - a European Lexicographic Infrastructure.

I hold an M.Sc. in Machine Learning from [Université Paris Descartes](http://www.mi.parisdescartes.fr/formations/master-informatique/specialite-intelligence-artificielle/) (2016-17) and an M.Sc. in Natural Language Processing from [Université Sorbonne Nouvelle](http://www.univ-paris3.fr/) (2014-16). During my masters, I worked in different research groups, particularly at [LIP6](https://www.lip6.fr/?LANG=en), [LIMSI](https://www.limsi.fr/en/), and [LIPN](http://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/en/), on quite various fields of co-reference resolution, language generation and, neural machine translation (here is one of [my master's theses](/docs/[Sina Ahmadi]Masters_thesis.pdf)). Back in 2013, as a member of [KLPP](http://eng.uok.ac.ir/esmaili/research/klpp/en/main.htm) project, I developed some of the fundamental language processing tools for Kurdish. I obtained my B.Sc. in Software Engineering in 2014 at University of Kurdistan, Faculty of Engineering.

As a multidisciplinary explorer, my research experiences and academic background lie at the junction of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am also interested in applied mathematics, neural networks design, and less-resourced languages processing.
