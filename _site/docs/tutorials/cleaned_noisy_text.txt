_______________________________________________________________________

PHI Service Company, a subsidiary service company of PHI, provides a
variety of support services, including legal, accounting, treasury,
tax, purchasing and information technology services, to PHI and its
operating subsidiaries. These services are provided pursuant to a
service agreement among PHI, PHI Service Company and the participating
operating subsidiaries. The expenses of PHI Service Company are charged
to PHI and the participating operating subsidiaries in accordance with
cost allocation methods set forth in the service agreement.

Pepco Holdings management has identified its operating segments at
December 31, 2011 as (i) Power Delivery, consisting of the operations
of Pepco, DPL and ACE, engaged primarily in the transmission,
distribution and default supply of electricity and the distribution and
supply of natural gas, (ii) Pepco Energy Services and (iii) Other
Non-Regulated, consisting primarily of the operations of PCI. For
financial information relating to PHIs segments, see Note (5),
Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements of PHI.

Discontinued Operations

In April 2010, the Board of Directors approved a plan for the
disposition of PHIs competitive wholesale power generation, marketing
and supply business, which had been conducted through subsidiaries of
Conectiv Energy Holding Company (Conectiv Energy). On July 1, 2010, PHI
completed the sale of Conectiv Energys wholesale power generation
business to Calpine Corporation (Calpine) for $1.64 billion. The
disposition of Conectiv Energys remaining assets and businesses not
included in the Calpine sale, including its load service supply
contracts, energy hedging portfolio and certain tolling agreements, has
been substantially completed. The operations of Conectiv Energy, which
previously comprised a separate segment for financial reporting
purposes, are being accounted for as a discontinued operation. For
further information on the former Conectiv Energy segment and the
disposition of its assets, operations and obligations, see Note (20),

Business Strategy

PHIs business strategy is to become a top-performing, regulated power
delivery company focused on:

investing in transmission and distribution infrastructure to improve
reliability of electric service;

building a smarter grid to automate certain functions on the electric
system, restore power more efficiently and provide customers detailed
energy information to help them control their energy costs;

investing in advanced technologies, new processes and personnel to
enhance the customer experience during power restoration, including
delivering enhanced customer communications;

pursuing a regulatory strategy that results in earning reasonable rates
of return and timely cost recovery of PHIs investments;

_______________________________________________________________________

growing PHIs energy services business by providing comprehensive
energy management solutions and developing, installing and operating
renewable energy solutions; and

demonstrating PHIs core values of safety, diversity and environmental
stewardship through PHIs business approaches and tangible business
practices and outcomes.

To further its business strategy, PHI may examine transactions
involving its existing businesses, including entering into joint
ventures, disposing of businesses or making acquisitions. PHI also may
refine components of its business strategy as it deems necessary or
appropriate in response to business factors and conditions, including
regulatory requirements.

Description of Business

Power Delivery

PHIs primary business is Power Delivery. Power Delivery in 2011, 2010
and 2009, produced 79%, 73%, and 67%, respectively, of PHIs
consolidated operating revenues and 78%, 81%, and 78%, respectively, of
PHIs consolidated operating income.

Each utility comprising Power Delivery is regulated in the
jurisdictions that encompass its electricity distribution service
territory and is regulated by FERC for its electricity transmission
facilities. DPL also is a regulated natural gas utility serving
portions of Delaware. In the aggregate, Power Delivery distributes
electricity to more than 1.8 million customers in the mid-Atlantic
region and delivers natural gas to approximately 124,000 customers in
Delaware. None of PHIs three utilities owns any electric generation

Distribution and Default Supply of Electricity

Pepco, DPL and ACE each owns and operates a network of wires,
substations and other equipment that are classified as transmission
facilities, distribution facilities or common facilities (which are
used for both transmission and distribution). Transmission facilities
carry wholesale electricity into, or across, the utilitys service
territory. Distribution facilities carry electricity from the
transmission facilities to the end-use customers located in the
utilitys service territory.

Each utility is responsible for the distribution of electricity in its
service territory, for which it is paid tariff rates established by the
applicable local public service commissions. Each utility also supplies
electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service
territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive
retail supplier. The regulatory term for this default supply service is
Standard Offer Service (SOS) in Delaware, the District of Columbia and
Maryland, and Basic Generation Service (BGS) in New Jersey. In this
Form 10-K, these supply services are referred to generally as Default
Electricity Supply.

Transmission of Electricity and Relationship with PJM

The transmission facilities owned by Pepco, DPL and ACE are
interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities
and are part of an interstate power transmission grid over which
electricity is transmitted throughout the mid-Atlantic portion of the
United States and parts of the Midwest. Pepco, DPL and ACE each is a
member of the PJM Regional Transmission Organization (PJM RTO), the
regional transmission organization designated by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) to coordinate the movement of wholesale
electricity within a region consisting of all or parts of Delaware,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and
the District of Columbia.

_______________________________________________________________________

PJM, the FERC-approved independent grid operator, manages the
transmission grid and the wholesale electricity market in the PJM RTO
region. Any entity that wishes to have wholesale electricity delivered
at any point within the PJM RTO region must obtain transmission
services from PJM. In accordance with FERC-approved rules, Pepco, DPL,
ACE and the other transmission-owning utilities in the region make
their transmission facilities available to the PJM RTO, and PJM directs
and controls the operation of these transmission facilities. For
transmission services, transmission owners are paid rates proposed by
the transmission owner and approved by FERC. PJM provides billing and
settlement services, collects transmission service revenue from
transmission service customers and distributes the revenue to the
transmission owners. PJM also directs the regional transmission
planning process within the PJM RTO region. The PJM Board of Managers
reviews and approves each PJM regional transmission expansion plan,
including whether to include new construction of transmission
facilities proposed by PJM RTO members in the plan and, if so, the
target in-service date for those facilities.

Seasonality

The operating results of Power Delivery historically have been directly
related to the volume of electricity delivered to its customers,
producing higher revenues and net income during periods when customers
consumed higher amounts of electricity (usually during periods of
extreme temperatures) and lower revenues and net income during periods
when customers consumed lower amounts of electricity (usually during
periods of mild temperatures). This has been due in part to the long
standing practice by which the applicable public service commissions
set distribution rates based on a fixed charge per kilowatt-hour of
electricity used by the customer. Because most of the costs associated
with the distribution of electricity do not vary with the volume of
electricity delivered, this pricing mechanism also contributed to
seasonal variations in net income. As a result of the implementation of
a BSA for retail customers of Pepco and DPL in Maryland in June 2007
and for customers of Pepco in the District of Columbia in November
2009, distribution revenues have been decoupled from the amount of
electricity delivered. Under the BSA, utility customers pay an approved
distribution charge for their electric service which does not vary by
electricity usage. This change has had the effect of aligning annual
distribution revenues more closely with annual distribution costs. In
addition, the change has had the effect of eliminating changes in
customer electricity usage, whether due to weather conditions or for
any other reason, as a factor having an impact on annual distribution
revenue and net income in those jurisdictions. The BSA also eliminates
what otherwise might be a disincentive for the utility to aggressively
develop and promote efficiency programs. Distribution revenues are not
decoupled for the distribution of electricity and natural gas by DPL in
Delaware or for the distribution of electricity by ACE in New Jersey,
and thus are subject to variability due to changes in customer

In contrast to electricity distribution costs, the cost of the
electricity supplied, which is the largest component of a customers
bill, does vary directly in relation to the volume of electricity used
by a customer. Accordingly, whether or not a BSA is in effect for the
jurisdiction, the revenues of Pepco, DPL and ACE from the supply of
electricity and natural gas vary based on consumption and on this basis
are seasonal. Because the revenues received by each of the utility
subsidiaries for the default supply of electricity and natural gas
closely approximate the supply costs, the impact on net income is
immaterial, and therefore is not seasonal.

Regulated Utility Subsidiaries

The following is a more detailed description of the business of each of
PHIs three regulated utility subsidiaries:

_______________________________________________________________________

Pepco

Pepco is engaged in the transmission, distribution and default supply
of electricity in the District of Columbia and major portions of Prince
Georges County and Montgomery County in Maryland. Pepcos service
territory covers approximately 640 square miles and has a population of
approximately 2.2 million. As of December 31, 2011, Pepco distributed
electricity to 788,000 customers (of which 257,000 were located in the
District of Columbia and 531,000 were located in Maryland), as compared
to 787,000 customers as of December 31, 2010 (of which 256,000 were
located in the District of Columbia and 531,000 were located in
Maryland). As of December 31, 2009, Pepco distributed electricity to
778,000 customers (of which 252,000 were located in the District of
Columbia and 526,000 were located in Maryland).

In 2011, Pepco distributed a total of 26,895,000 megawatt hours of
electricity, of which 57% was distributed within its Maryland territory
and 43% within the District of Columbia. Of this amount, 30% of the
total megawatt hours were delivered to residential customers, 50% to
commercial customers, and 20% to United States and District of Columbia
government customers. In 2010, Pepco distributed a total of 27,665,000
megawatt hours of electricity, of which 57% was distributed within its
Maryland territory and 43% within the District of Columbia. Of this
amount, 30% of the total megawatt hours were distributed to residential
customers, 49% to commercial customers, and 21% to United States and
District of Columbia government customers. In 2009, Pepco distributed a
total of 26,549,000 megawatt hours of electricity, of which 57% was
distributed within its Maryland territory and 43% within the District
of Columbia. Of this amount, 29% of the total megawatt hours were
distributed to residential customers, 50% to commercial customers, and
21% to United States and District of Columbia government customers.

Pepco has been providing SOS in Maryland since July 2004. Pursuant to
orders issued by the Maryland Public Service Commission (MPSC), Pepco
is obligated to provide SOS (i) to residential and small commercial
customers until further action of the Maryland General Assembly and
(ii) to medium-sized commercial customers through November 2012. Pepco
purchases the electricity required to satisfy these SOS obligations
from wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into in accordance
with competitive bid procedures approved and supervised by the MPSC.
Pepco also is obligated to provide Standard Offer Service, known as
Hourly Priced Service (HPS), for large Maryland customers. Power to
supply HPS customers is acquired in next-day and other short-term PJM
RTO markets. Pepco is entitled to recover from its SOS customers the
cost of acquiring the SOS supply, plus an administrative charge that is
intended to allow Pepco to recover the administrative costs incurred to
provide the SOS and a modest margin. Because the margin varies by
customer class, the actual average margin over any given time period
depends on the number of Maryland SOS customers in each customer class
and the electricity used by such customers. Pepco is paid tariff rates
for the distribution of electricity over its transmission and
distribution facilities to all electricity customers in its Maryland
service territory regardless of whether the customer receives SOS or
purchases electricity from another supplier.

Pepco has been providing SOS in the District of Columbia since February
2005. Pursuant to orders issued by the District of Columbia Public
Service Commission (DCPSC), Pepco is obligated to provide SOS to
residential and small, medium-sized and large commercial customers
indefinitely. Pepco purchases the electricity required to satisfy its
SOS obligations from wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into
in accordance with a competitive bid procedure approved and supervised
by the DCPSC. Pepco is entitled to recover from its SOS customers the
costs of acquiring the SOS supply, plus an administrative charge that
is intended to allow Pepco to recover the administrative costs incurred
to provide the SOS and a modest margin. Because the margin varies by
customer class, the actual average margin over any given time period
depends on the number of District of Columbia SOS customers in each
customer class and the amount of electricity used by such customers.
Pepco is paid tariff rates for the distribution of electricity over its
transmission and distribution facilities to all electricity customers
in its District of Columbia service territory regardless of whether the
customer receives SOS or purchases electricity from another supplier.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, 43% of Pepcos Maryland
distribution sales (measured by megawatt hours) were to SOS customers,
as compared to 46% and 49% in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and 27% of
its District of Columbia distribution sales (measured by megawatt
hours) were to SOS customers in 2011, as compared to 29% and 31% in
2010 and 2009, respectively.
